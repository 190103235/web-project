I made the Tele 2 website. It is a major telephone operator in the Nordic and Baltic countries and an alternative provider in many others, with about 17 million customers in 8 countries and under franchise in 1 additional countries. In my site you can see several pages like main page, personal account, number selection, registration, 4G, COVID-19. In the main page you can choose tariffs for your phone and can read information about Tele2 services. In personal account page you can log in or create a new account, if haven't yet. Next page is number selection page which allows to select a phone number you want. Registration page for registering your phone numbers online. Next page called 4G, it provides detailed information about what is 4G, also how to use it. And last page is COVID-19, we know that nowadays it's most popular topic all around the world, in this page you can find interesting activities to how to send your leisure time in quarantine.
